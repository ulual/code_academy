We were given a list of lists, where each sublist holds the title of a famous book that has a year as its title and the last name of the author that wrote the book. Unfortunately, when this list was made, each of the books was accidentally entered twice—once with the title as a numeric value and once with the title as a string. Use the filter() function to deduplicate the list and keep only the sublists that have the book title stored as a string:
"""
# Your code below: 
# assign the result of your filter function to the variable  string_titles
string_titles = filter(lambda title: type(title[1]) == str, books)
print(string_titles)
# convert your filter object to a list stored in the variable string_titles_list
string_titles_list = list(string_titles)
# print the list string_titles_list
print(string_titles_list)
