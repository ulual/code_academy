We were given a list of lists, where each sublist holds the title of a famous book that has a year as its title and the last name of the author that wrote the book. Unfortunately, when this list was made, each of the books was accidentally entered twiceâ€”once with the title as a numeric value and once with the title as a string. Use the filter() function to deduplicate the list and keep only the sublists that have the book title stored as a string:
"""
# Your code below: 
# assign the result of your filter function to the variable  string_titles
string_titles = filter(lambda title: type(title[1]) == str, books)
print(string_titles)
# convert your filter object to a list stored in the variable string_titles_list
string_titles_list = list(string_titles)
# print the list string_titles_list
print(string_titles_list)
